  <h1>Welcome to Evented</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Evented</strong> is a Chrome Extension that helps you convert highlighted text or manual input into fully structured Google Calendar events using AI (OpenAI). 
    It reads event-like text (e.g. "Dinner at 7pm at John's") and schedules it automatically to your Google Calendar.
  </p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can either highlight text on a webpage or manually type/paste it into the built-in textbox.</li>
    <li>Click "Create Event" to send the input to OpenAI and generate an event.</li>
    <li>If you’ve signed into Google, the event will be added directly to your Calendar.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Using Your Own OpenAI API Key</h2>
  <p>
    For privacy and to avoid sharing keys, you must use and pay for your own OpenAI API key.
    <br>
    1. Visit <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys" target="_blank">OpenAI API Keys</a> to create a key.
    <br>
    2. Paste your key into the Settings section of the extension popup.
    <br>
    3. You can choose from the two supported GPT model (e.g. <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>, <code>gpt-4</code>).
  </p>

  <p>
    You are responsible for any costs incurred. See full pricing here: 
    <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing" target="_blank">OpenAI Pricing</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Evented never stores your API key or data externally. All processing happens locally in the extension, and event creation only occurs when you explicitly allow access to your Google Calendar.
