    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 11, 2025</p>

    <h4>Data Collected and Handled</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Text Input:</strong> Only the text you highlight or type, and then submit by clicking the create button, is used to create events. </li>
      <li><strong>Google User Data:</strong> If you sign in with Google, Evented uses only an authentication token and permission to insert new events into your primary calendar. This data is used solely to create events you request. It does not read or modify any existing events, nor access other calendar data.</li>
      </li>
      <li><strong>API Key:</strong> Your personal OpenAI API key that is used to interpret your highlighted or typed text into structured calendar event details (title, location, start/end time, etc.). </li>
      <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Your chosen OpenAI model to process your input text into structured calendar event details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Data Storage and Retention</h4>
    <p>
      All settings, API keys, and model preferences are saved locally using Chrome’s <code>storage.local</code> until you remove (reset) them. No data is stored on Evented-controlled servers. Google authentication tokens are stored securely using Chrome Identity API and can be revoked at any time by signing out.
      Input event data is held only temporarily in memory while processing your request, then discarded. 
    </p>

  <h4>When and How Data Is Sent & Used</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>OpenAI API:</strong> When you click the “Create” button, the highlighted or typed text is sent over a secure HTTPS connection to convert it into structured event details (title, location, start_time, end_time).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Google Calendar API:</strong> If signed in and access is granted, Evented sends the event details to your Google account’s primary calendar in standard Google Calendar format. No other calendar data is accessed or read.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Signed Out:</strong> If you are signed out, no Google Calendar API calls are made and no Google user data is accessed.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h4>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
    <p>
      Evented does not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third party for purposes other than processing your text input to create calendar events. Data is shared only with OpenAI (to interpret and structure your text input) and Google (to create Google Calendar events).
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both OpenAI and Google handle your data under their respective privacy policies:
      <a href="https://openai.com/privacy/" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a> and 
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Data Protection</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>All communication with external APIs uses secure HTTPS encryption.</li>
      <li>OAuth 2.0 is used for Google authentication, ensuring tokens are securely handled.</li>
      <li>Your API key is stored locally in Chrome and never transmitted to any external Evented-controlled server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>User Control</h4>
    <p>
      You may:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove or update (reset) your OpenAI API key and preferences from within the extension.</li>
      <li>Sign out of Google from the extension at any time to revoke all Google Calendar access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Changes to This Policy</h4>
    <p>
      If changes are made to this policy, the “Effective Date” will be updated, and the revised version will be posted here. Please check this page periodically for updates.
